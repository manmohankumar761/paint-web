# paint-web

This is a fun paint web app.
One fine day I discovered about canvas in html5, so tried tinkering up with it.
You can try this here:https://github.com/manmohankumar761/paint-web

## Initial development-
1. It only had one color and thickness too cannot be changed.
2. it only had inputs via mouse and no touch.
![github web paint()



As of now I was using eventListener for mouse to draw the objects on canvas, but I was facing a problem of not able to undertake the ones which required touch inputs

#Repo Updated 🔥 🔥-
1.You can pick color as per your desire with the help of picker. 😆😆
2.I have also added the thickness changer which uses the range type to change thickness of brush 😇:innocent:
3.I have added functionality of undo,clear and eraser too 😎 😎

## Feel free to to send suggestions( and criticism too if any😅)
